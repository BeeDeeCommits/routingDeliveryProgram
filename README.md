# Elite Routing Program

Elite Routing program simulates a Package delivery service and uses nearest neighbor algorithm as a solution 
to efficiently deliver packages. 

***

### Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

The nearest neighbor algorithm as implemented in the program delivers packages  
to the nearest delivery location relative to our current location.
